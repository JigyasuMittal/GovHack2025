# Use of AI in GovMate

ChatGPT was used during the development of this project to:

- Research relevant government datasets and methodologies (e.g., SEIFA, AGOR, ABS Labour Force Survey).  
- Brainstorm potential features and user workflows for the GovMate platform.  
- Draft and refine the project description, data story, and supporting documentation.  
- Suggest and finalize the project name **“GovMate”** .

All AI contributions were focused on ideation, documentation support, and accelerating the creative process. The implementation, integration of datasets, and development of the GovMate system were carried out independently.
