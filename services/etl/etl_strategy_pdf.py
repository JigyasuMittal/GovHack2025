"""ETL for Services Australia Automation & AI Strategy PDF.

This script downloads the Automation and AI Strategy 2025â€“27 PDF from
Services Australia, extracts the high-level principle headings, and
writes them to a YAML file for inclusion in rulecards and citations.
Due to the complexity of reliably parsing PDFs, this implementation
focuses on downloading and storing the PDF. Manual extraction of
headings may be performed outside the pipeline and checked into the
repository. The provenance entry in `data/provenance.json` should
record the download timestamp and file path.
