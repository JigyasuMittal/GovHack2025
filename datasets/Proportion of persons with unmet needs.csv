"a. People with disability restricted to those aged 0-64 years."
"b. The selected metric for people aged 65 years and over only captures people living in households (i.e. persons who reside in a private dwelling or self-care retirement village), so excludes people living in residential aged care."
"c. Data for 2022 is sourced from Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) 2022. This data is not comparable to previous years due to differences in the population definitions between the Report on Government Services and the SDAC 2022."
