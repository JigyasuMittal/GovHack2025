"a. Persons with a disability restricted to those aged 15-64 years."
"b. The proportion of people who are satisfied with the quality of assistance received from organised and formal services in the 6 months prior to the survey. The selected metric for people aged 65 years and over only captures people living in households (i.e. persons who reside in a private dwelling or self-care retirement village), so excludes people living in residential aged care."
"c. Data for 2022 is sourced from Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) 2022. Data presented for 2022 is not comparable to previous years due to differences in the Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers question methodology."
